# Abstract
The [Credit Collective](https://www.credit-collective.com/) is a group of builders and investors dedicated to advancing blockchain-based real-world credit solutions. The community already numbers dozens of projects & investors actively engaged.
A problem and opportunity common to all these projects is finding initial on-chain liquidity to validate novel RWA lending models and open the doors to growth. This presents an unique opportunity for Celo to establish itself as the leader in on-chain lending.
This proposal requests up to 2MM cEUR funding from the Celo Community Fund to accelerate debt liquidity and to catalyze the growth of Celo’s RWA and lending protocols ecosystem.


# Background
## The Problem & the Opportunity 
We want to start by adding a new KPI to the blockchain discussion that today is overlooked but we believe will become one of the key success factors: Total Debt Value Locked 

While TVL represents the value of all the assets on-chain, Total Debt Value Locked represents the total stable-coins locked in smart contracts and being lent for real-world use cases. Existing examples from Credit Collective members include: loans to small businesses in Africa, factoring loans to farmers in Latam, retail loans to Venezuelan immigrants, etc. 

At the moment it might feel like a “niche” KPI, but if we all believe that blockchain will become the infrastructure of the next financial system, and believe that Celo should be its home, than this is the KPI that we should be looking at. It’s still small globally, and we as a community have the ability to become a leading player. 

That’s what we are going after - making sure that the leading debt pools out there will be deployed on Celo. 

# The Credit Collective
Credit Collective was seeded by Flori Ventures and is presently led by [Tomer Bariach](https://www.linkedin.com/in/tomer-bariach/) and [Reuven Palatnik](https://www.linkedin.com/in/reuvenpalatnik/). We recently published a [“Credit Collective Hello world”](https://forum.celo.org/t/credit-collective-hello-world/5789/15) forum post describing our activities and goals. It is advisable to review it before proceeding.

# Proposal
This proposal details Credit Collective’s request for 2MM cEUR that will enable us to start seeding liquidity into new liquidity debt pools launched on Celo, and elevate our thought-leadership work and strategic partnerships. 
Credit Collective proposes to utilize funds in line with our two strategic objectives, covered in detail in the previously referenced forum post.
## Staking pools on Celo (75%)
A minimum of three quarters of the funds will be dedicated to staking into debt pools on Celo. The following parameters will be used when making staking decisions:
We will invest in debt pools supporting the following industries:
Microfinance
Real-world assets 
Renewable energy
Other opportunities that arise 
We aim to stake ~100-150K cEUR to 10-15 different pools initially
We will stake only to companies who have already lent from their own balance sheet 
We will not comprise more than 30% of the total capital in a pool
We will re-stake returned funds into new pools
We will converted to a stablecoin and restake rewards received in additional tokens
We will report on our key success factor, which is the total stable coins staked on Celo to real-world lending applications after 2 years
## Market Maturity and Commercialization (25%) 
Up to 25% of the funds will be used to grow the community and market for RWA on chain lending. Some example activities planned include:
Conducting vertical-focused research on market opportunities that would benefit from brand-recognized academic partnerships to speed up institutional adoption; expand on chain credit data and its exposure to Tradifi 
Leading monthly community meetings & twitter spaces for global exposure 
Leading the activation and facilitation of an on chain Debt DAO 
Organizing real life events around blockchain conferences and events
Creating a global dashboard of on-chain credit solutions
Supporting Web 2.0 lending companies in the adoption of blockchain technologies 
Creating a community of co-investor LPs to join us staking to pools
Analyze technology and other key unlocks to make CELO the leader in on chain debt pools
Known Risks
Informed by our knowledge in the blockchain space, we have identified the following risks:
Market risk: adverse events in crypto markets can severely reduce the value of funds available. This is mitigated by denominating the budget request in cEUR.
Because our goal is to seed new pools, there is a relatively higher risk of defaults. We expect the yield generated will cover potential loss across all staking pools.
# Deployment
## cEUR Denominated Budget
To reduce implementation risk, and since lending pools are funded with stable coins, we plan to denominate our budget in cEUR, understanding that there exists the requested amount of cEUR in the Celo Community Fund and this will not create any adverse effect on price the CELO. 
## Multisig
A Multisig wallet will be used to manage and deploy the funds with a required 3 of 5 approvals for transactions. The Multisig contract address is 0xxxxxxxxxxxx and can be found here.
The initial signers on this multisig are:
- Tomer Bariach: 
- Reuven Palatnik: 
- Ryan Nesbitt: 
- Nirvaan Ranganathan:

# Road to sustainability 
We intend to turn the Credit Collective into a self-sustaining organization by the end of these two years in two main ways (and will explore further opportunities during the 2 year implementation):

Membership Fee - to replace the funding for the “Market Maturity” and community building work, members of the Credit Collective will pay membership fees. We believe the value we will deliver at the end of the 2 years will be sufficient to justify a sustainable membership fee 
Debt DAO - to augment the funding for the staking pool, which will be sponsored by the community, and managed by the community
